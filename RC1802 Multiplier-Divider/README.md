# RC1802 Multiplier-Divider

This design is for a PCB card compatible with the RC1802 Cosmac ELF computer.
It uses am RCA CDP1855 integrated circuit capable of 8x8 bit integer multiplication and 16/8 division.
As of 22Feb2015 thew gerber files have been sent to manufactoruing and the PCB should be available in a week or so.

# Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a starting point for ordering PCBs.
Gerbers will be supplied after assembly and testing.

# BOM

The IC's seem to be readily availble on eBay, but they have yet to be tested.
